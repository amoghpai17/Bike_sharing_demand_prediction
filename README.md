# Bike_sharing_demand_prediction

Problem Statement
The problem is to predict the demand for bike sharing services using machine learning based on historical data and other relevant factors such as weather, time of day, day of the week, holidays, and events. The objective is to optimize inventory, pricing, and marketing strategies to maximize revenue and improve customer satisfaction.



Project Summary -
The given dataset appears to be clean, as there are no null values present. Analysis of the data reveals several interesting insights.

Firstly, the probability of renting a bike is higher in the evening compared to other times of the day. This suggests that people may be using bikes for commuting to and from work. Secondly, the summer season has the highest demand for bike rentals, which is not surprising since it is a popular time for outdoor activities.

Thirdly, bike rentals are more common on non-holidays than holidays. This suggests that people may be using bikes for their daily routines and errands, rather than for leisure activities. Additionally, bikes are rented only on functioning days, indicating that the bikes are mainly used for commuting purposes.

The dataset also shows that the bike rentals are highest between May and August, with a sudden hike in October. This could be due to special events or festivals occurring during that time. The first weekend has a peak in bike rentals, and then it remains stable. This suggests that people may be using bikes for leisure activities on weekends.

Finally, there is a linear growth in bike rentals over the years, indicating that the bike rental business is growing steadily. To further understand the trends, three machine learning models were built, including Linear Regression, K-Nearest Neighbor Regressor, and Random Forest Regressor. Among these models, Random Forest Regressor performed the best with an r2 score of 0.829. This model can be used to predict future bike rental demand accurately.

In conclusion, the bike rental business appears to be doing well, with steady growth over the years. The demand for bikes is highest in the summer season, on functioning days, and on non-holidays. The Random Forest Regressor model can be used to predict future bike rental demand accurately, helping the business to plan for future growth and profitability.
